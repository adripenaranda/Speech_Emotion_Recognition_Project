The Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) project focuses on creating a Python-based model that can detect 
human emotions from speech using the Librosa library and machine learning techniques. This 
application is particularly useful for call centers, where recognizing customer emotions can improve 
service quality and boost conversion rates. By leveraging the dataset, which includes emotionally labeled 
speech and song files, we will extract crucial audio features using Librosa, train a machine learning 
model, and assess its accuracy. 

This project provides practical experience in audio processing and machine learning, showcasing the 
effective integration of these technologies in understanding human emotions. By carrying out this 
project, we will gain hands-on experience in audio processing, feature extraction, and machine learning 
model training, offering a thorough understanding of SER systems.
